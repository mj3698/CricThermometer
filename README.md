# CricThermometer
This is my very first Android Project. In this project the user can get the Surrounding temperature without using any thermometer.
This application calculates the temperature based on the Cricket Chirps. 
Crickets are cold-blooded and take on the temperature of their surroundings. 
In order to calculate the temperature just count the number of chirps produced by the cricket in 14/25 seconds
And this count will give you the surrounding temperature within few seconds.

Thnak You:)
